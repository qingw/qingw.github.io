    <p><strong>1.    Complete nondestructive analysis of two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled Bell states assisted by cross-Kerr nonlinearity</strong><br />

<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperentanglement, the entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system, has attracted much attention as it can be used to increase the channel capacity of quantum communication and its security largely. Here, we present the first scheme to completely distinguish the hyperentangled Bell states of two-photon systems in three DOFs with the help of cross-Kerr nonlinearity without destruction, including two longitudinal momentum DOFs and the polarization DOF. We use cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum nondemolition detectors which can be used to make a parity-check measurement and analyze Bell states of two-photon systems in different DOFs. Our complete scheme for two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled Bell-state analysis may be useful for the practical applications in quantum information, especially in long-distance high-capacity quantum communication. We show its applications in hyperentanglement swapping and hyperdense coding with two-photon systems entangled in three DOFs simultaneously.

Fabian Elster, Sonja Barkhofen, Thomas Nitsche, Jaroslav Novotn?, Aurél Gábris, Igor Jex, Christine Silberhorn<br />
Scientific Reports 5 (2015) 13495<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.01269</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Coherent evolution governs the behaviour of all quantum systems, but in nature it is often subjected to influence of a classical environment. For analysing quantum transport phenomena quantum walks emerge as suitable model systems. In particular, quantum walks on percolation structures constitute an attractive platform for studying open system dynamics of random media. Here, we present an implementation of quantum walks differing from the previous experiments by achieving dynamical control of the underlying graph structure. We demonstrate the evolution of an optical time-multiplexed quantum walk over six double steps, revealing the intricate interplay between the internal and external degrees of freedom. The observation of clear non-Markovian signatures in the coin space testifies the high coherence of the implementation and the extraordinary degree of control of all system parameters. Our work is the proof-of-principle experiment of a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation graph, paving the way towards complex simulation of quantum transport in random media.

<p><strong>5.    Separations in query complexity using cheat sheets</strong><br />
Scott Aaronson, Shalev Ben-David, Robin Kothari<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.01937</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show a power 2.5 separation between bounded-error randomized and quantum query complexity for a total Boolean function, refuting the widely believed conjecture that the best such separation could only be quadratic (from Grover's algorithm). We also present a total function with a power 4 separation between quantum query complexity and approximate polynomial degree, showing severe limitations on the power of the polynomial method. Finally, we exhibit a total function with a quadratic gap between quantum query complexity and certificate complexity, which is optimal (up to log factors). These separations are shown using a new, general technique that we call the cheat sheet technique. The technique is based on a generic transformation that converts any (possibly partial) function into a new total function with desirable properties for showing separations. The framework also allows many known separations, including some recent breakthrough results of Ambainis et al., to be shown in a unified manner.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum linear systems algorithm with exponentially improved dependence on precision</strong><br />
Andrew M. Childs, Robin Kothari, Rolando D. Somma<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.02306</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd showed that for a suitably specified $N \times N$ matrix $A$ and $N$-dimensional vector $\vec{b}$, there is a quantum algorithm that outputs a quantum state proportional to the solution of the linear system of equations $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. If $A$ is sparse and well-conditioned, their algorithm runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(\log N, 1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output state. We improve this to an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$, exponentially improving the dependence on precision while keeping essentially the same dependence on other parameters. Our algorithm is based on a general technique for implementing any operator with a suitable Fourier or Chebyshev series representation. This allows us to bypass the quantum phase estimation algorithm, whose dependence on $\epsilon$ is prohibitive.

<p><strong>7.    An almost convincing scheme for discriminating the preparation basis of quantum ensemble and why it will not work</strong><br />
Sandeep K Goyal, Rajeev Singh, Sibasish Ghosh<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.03149</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mixed states of a quantum system, represented by density operators, can be decomposed as a statistical mixture of pure states in a number of ways where each decomposition can be viewed as a different preparation recipe. However the fact that the density matrix contains full information about the ensemble makes it impossible to estimate the preparation basis for the quantum system. Here we present a measurement scheme to (seemingly) improve the performance of unsharp measurements. We argue that in some situations this scheme is capable of providing statistics from a single copy of the quantum system, thus, making it possible to perform state tomography from a single copy. One of the byproduct of the scheme is a way to distinguish between different preparation methods used to prepare the state of the quantum system. However, our numerical simulations disagree with our intuitive predictions. We show that a counter-intuitive property of biased classical random walk is responsible for the proposed mechanism to not work.

<p><strong>8.    Quantum Walks With Neutral Atoms: Quantum Interference Effects of One and Two Particles</strong><br />
Carsten Robens, Stefan Brakhane, Dieter Meschede, Andrea Alberti<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.03569</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on the state of the art of quantum walk experiments with neutral atoms in state-dependent optical lattices. We demonstrate a novel state-dependent transport technique enabling the control of two spin-selective sublattices in a fully independent fashion. This transport technique allowed us to carry out a test of single-particle quantum interference based on the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality and, more recently, to probe two-particle quantum interference effects with neutral atoms cooled into the motional ground state. These experiments lay the groundwork for the study of discrete-time quantum walks of strongly interacting, indistinguishable particles to demonstrate quantum cellular automata of neutral atoms.

<p><strong>9.    The defect-induced localization in many positions of the quantum random walk</strong><br />
Tian Chen, Xiangdong Zhang<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.03793</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the localization of probability distribution in a discrete quantum random walk on an infinite chain. With a phase defect introduced in any position of the quantum random walk (QRW), we have found that the localization of the probability distribution in the QRW emerges. Different localized behaviors of the probability distribution in the QRW are presented when the defect occupies different positions. Given that the coefficients of the localized stationary eigenstates relies on the coin operator, we reveal that when the defect occupies different positions, the amplitude of localized probability distribution in the QRW exhibits a non-trivial dependence on the coin operator.

<p><strong>10.    Doubling the Success of Quantum Walk Search Using Internal-State Measurements</strong><br />
Kri?jānis Prūsis, Jevgēnijs Vihrovs, Thomas G. Wong<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.03865</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In typical discrete-time quantum walk algorithms, one measures the position of the walker while ignoring its internal spin/coin state. Rather than neglecting the information in this internal state, we show that additionally measuring it doubles the success probability of many quantum spatial search algorithms. For example, this allows Grover's unstructured search problem to be solved with certainty, rather than with probability 1/2 if only the walker's position is measured, so the additional measurement yields a search algorithm that is twice as fast as without it, on average. Thus the internal state of discrete-time quantum walks holds valuable information that can be utilized to improve algorithms. Furthermore, we determine conditions for which spatial search problems are amenable to this doubling of the success probability, and this involves diagrammatically analyzing search using degenerate perturbation theory and deriving a useful formula for how the quantum walk acts in its reduced subspace.

<p><strong>11.    Virtually Abelian Quantum Walks</strong><br />
Giacomo Mauro D’Ariano, Marco Erba, Paolo Perinotti, Alessandro Tosini<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.03992</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce quantum walks on Cayley graphs of non-Abelian groups. We focus on the easiest case of virtually Abelian groups, and introduce a technique to reduce the quantum walk to an equivalent one on an Abelian group with coin system having larger dimension. We apply the technique in the case of two quantum walks on virtually Abelian groups with planar Cayley graphs, finding the exact solution.

<p><strong>12.    Entanglement dynamics of two-particle quantum walks</strong><br />
G. R. Carson, T. Loke, J. B. Wang<br />
Quantum Inf Process 14, 3193, 2015<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.04828</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper explores the entanglement dynamics generated by interacting two-particle quantum walks on degree-regular and -irregular graphs. We performed spectral analysis of the time-evolution of both the particle probability distribution and the entanglement between the two particles for various interaction strength. While the particle probability distributions are stable and not sensitive to perturbations in the interaction strength, the entanglement dynamics are found to be much more sensitive to system variations. This property may be utilised to probe small differences in the system parameters.

<p><strong>13.    Quantum Walks with Gremlin</strong><br />
Marko A. Rodriguez, Jennifer H. Watkins<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06278</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum walk places a traverser into a superposition of both graph location and traversal "spin." The walk is defined by an initial condition, an evolution determined by a unitary coin/shift-operator, and a measurement based on the sampling of the probability distribution generated from the quantum wavefunction. Simple quantum walks are studied analytically, but for large graph structures with complex topologies, numerical solutions are typically required. For the quantum theorist, the Gremlin graph traversal machine and language can be used for the numerical analysis of quantum walks on such structures. Additionally, for the graph theorist, the adoption of quantum walk principles can transform what are currently side-effect laden traversals into pure, stateless functional flows. This is true even when the constraints of quantum mechanics are not fully respected (e.g. reversible and unitary evolution). In sum, Gremlin allows both types of theorist to leverage each other's constructs for the advancement of their respective disciplines.

<p><strong>14.    Attractor-repeller pair of topological zero-modes in a nonlinear quantum walk</strong><br />
Y. Gerasimenko, B. Tarasinski, C. W. J. Beenakker<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.06657</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum-mechanical counterpart of a classical random walk offers a rich dynamics that has recently been shown to include topologically protected bound states (zero-modes) at boundaries or domain walls. Here we show that a topological zero-mode may acquire a dynamical role in the presence of nonlinearities. We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk that combines zero-modes with a particle-conserving nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The presence of both particle-hole and chiral symmetry converts two zero-modes of opposite chirality into an attractor-repeller pair of the nonlinear dynamics. This makes it possible to steer the walker towards a domain wall and trap it there.

<p><strong>15.    Generating quantum entanglement: benefits due to extended Hilbert space</strong><br />
Dmitry Solenov<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.08254</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quantum computing system is typically represented by a set of non-interacting (local) two-state systems---qubits. Many physical systems can naturally have more accessible states, both local and non-local. We show that the resulting non-local network of states connecting qubits can be efficiently addressed via continuous time quantum random walks, leading to substantial speed-up of multiqubit entanglement manipulations. We discuss a three-qubit Toffoli gate and a system of superconducting qubits as an illustration.

<p><strong>16.    Polynomials, Quantum Query Complexity, and Grothendieck’s Inequality</strong><br />
Scott Aaronson, Andris Ambainis, Jānis Iraids, Martins Kokainis, Juris Smotrovs<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.08682</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We show an equivalence between 1-query quantum algorithms and representations by degree-2 polynomials. Namely, a partial Boolean function $f$ is computable by a 1-query quantum algorithm with error bounded by $\epsilon&lt;1/2$ iff $f$ can be approximated by a degree-2 polynomial with error bounded by $\epsilon'&lt;1/2$. This result holds for two different notions of approximation by a polynomial: the standard definition of Nisan and Szegedy and the approximation by block-multilinear polynomials recently introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis (STOC'2015, arxiv:1411.5729). We also show two results for polynomials of higher degree. First, there is a total Boolean function which requires $\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ quantum queries but can be represented by a block-multilinear polynomial of degree $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. Thus, in the general case (for an arbitrary number of queries), block-multilinear polynomials are not equivalent to quantum algorithms. Second, for any constant degree $k$, the two notions of approximation by a polynomial (the standard and the block-multilinear) are equivalent. As a consequence, we solve an open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis, showing that one can estimate the value of any bounded degree-$k$ polynomial $p:\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow [-1, 1]$ with $O(n^{1-\frac{1}{2k}})$ queries.

<p><strong>17.    Quantum Walks on Generalized Quadrangles</strong><br />
Chris Godsil, Krystal Guo, Tor G.J. Myklebust<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.01962</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the transition matrix of a quantum walk on strongly regular graphs. It is proposed by Emms, Hancock, Severini and Wilson in 2006, that the spectrum of $S^+(U^3)$, a matrix based on the amplitudes of walks in the quantum walk, distinguishes strongly regular graphs. We probabilistically compute the spectrum of the line intersection graphs of two non-isomorphic generalized quadrangles of order $(5^2,5)$ under this matrix and thus provide strongly regular counter-examples to the conjecture.

<p><strong>18.    Relation between two-phase quantum walks and the topological invariant</strong><br />
Takako Endo, Norio Konno, Hideaki Obuse<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1511.04230</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a position-dependent discrete-time quantum walk (QW) in one dimension, whose time-evolution operator is built up from two coin operators which are distinguished by phase factors from $x\geq0$ and $x\leq-1$. We call the QW the ${\it complete\;two}$-${\it phase\;QW}$ to discern from the two-phase QW with one defect[13,14]. Because of its localization properties, the two-phase QWs can be considered as an ideal mathematical model of topological insulators which are novel quantum states of matter characterized by topological invariants. Employing the complete two-phase QW, we present the stationary measure, and two kinds of limit theorems concerning ${\it localization}$ and the ${\it ballistic\;spreading}$, which are the characteristic behaviors in the long-time limit of discrete-time QWs in one dimension. As a consequence, we obtain the mathematical expression of the whole picture of the asymptotic behavior of the walker in the long-time limit. We also clarify relevant symmetries, which are essential for topological insulators, of the complete two-phase QW, and then derive the topological invariant. Having established both mathematical rigorous results and the topological invariant of the complete two-phase QW, we provide solid arguments to understand localization of QWs in term of topological invariant. Furthermore, by applying a concept of ${\it\;topological\;protections}$, we clarify that localization of the two-phase QW with one defect, studied in the previous work[13], can be related to localization of the complete two-phase QW under symmetry preserving perturbations.
