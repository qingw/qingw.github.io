    <p><strong>1.    Complete hyperentangled-Bell-state analysis for photon systems assisted by quantum-dot spins in optical microcavities</strong><br />
Bao-Cang Ren, Hai-Rui Wei, Ming Hua, Tao Li, Fu-Guo Deng<br />
Optics Express 20, 24664-24677 (2012)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0168</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bell-state analysis (BSA) is essential in quantum communication, but it is impossible to distinguish unambiguously the four Bell states in the polarization degree of freedom (DOF) of two-photon systems with only linear optical elements, except for the case in which the BSA is assisted with hyperentangled states, the simultaneous entanglement in more than one DOF. Here, we propose a scheme to distinguish completely the 16 hyperentangled Bell states in both the polarization and the spatial-mode DOFs of two-photon systems, by using the giant nonlinear optics in quantum dot-cavity systems. This scheme can be applied to increase the channel capacity of long-distance quantum communication based on hyperentanglement, such as entanglement swapping, teleportation, and superdense coding. We use hyperentanglement swapping as an example to show the application of this HBSA.

<p><strong>2.    N-dimensional alternate coined quantum walks from a dispersion relation perspective</strong><br />
Eugenio Rold��n, Carlo Di Franco, Fernando Silva, Germ��n J. de Valc��rcel<br />
Phys. Rev. A 87, 022336 (2013)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3614</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an alternative definition of an N-dimensional coined quantum walk by generalizing a recent proposal [Di Franco et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 080502 (2011)]. This N-dimensional alternate quantum walk, AQW_N, in contrast with the standard definition of the N-dimensional quantum walk, QW_N, requires only a coin-qubit. We discuss the quantum diffusion properties of AQW_2 and AQW_3 by analyzing their dispersion relations that reveal, in particular, the existence of diabolical points. This allows us to highlight interesting similarities with other well known physical phenomena. We also demonstrate that AQW_3 generates genuine multipartite entanglement. Finally we discuss the implementability of AQW_N.

<p><strong>3.    Implementation of a spatial two-dimensional quantum random walk with tunable decoherence</strong><br />
Ji?�� Svozil��k, Roberto de Jes��s Le��n-Montiel, Juan P. Torres<br />
Phys. Rev. A 86, 052327 (2012)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4087</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We put forward a new, versatile and highly-scalable experimental setup for the realization of discrete two-dimensional quantum random walks with a single-qubit coin and tunable degree of decoherence. The proposed scheme makes use of a small number of simple optical components arranged in a multi-path Mach-Zehnder-like configuration, where a weak coherent state with average photon number of 1 is injected. Environmental effects (decoherence) are generated by a spatial light modulator, which introduces pure dephasing in the transverse spatial plane, perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the light beam. By controlling the characteristics of this dephasing, one can explore a great variety of scenarios of quantum random walks: pure quantum evolution (ballistic spread), fast fluctuating environment leading to a diffusive classical random walk, and static disorder resulting in the observation of Anderson localization.

<p><strong>4.    Comparing algorithms for graph isomorphism using discrete- and continuous-time quantum random walks</strong><br />
Kenneth Rudinger, John King Gamble, Eric Bach, Mark Friesen, Robert Joynt, S. N. Coppersmith<br />
J. Comut. Theor. Nanos. 10 (7), pp. 1653-1661 (2013)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4535</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Berry and Wang [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 83}, 042317 (2011)] show numerically that a discrete-time quantum random walk of two noninteracting particles is able to distinguish some non-isomorphic strongly regular graphs from the same family. Here we analytically demonstrate how it is possible for these walks to distinguish such graphs, while continuous-time quantum walks of two noninteracting particles cannot. We show analytically and numerically that even single-particle discrete-time quantum random walks can distinguish some strongly regular graphs, though not as many as two-particle noninteracting discrete-time walks. Additionally, we demonstrate how, given the same quantum random walk, subtle differences in the graph certificate construction algorithm can nontrivially impact the walk's distinguishing power. We also show that no continuous-time walk of a fixed number of particles can distinguish all strongly regular graphs when used in conjunction with any of the graph certificates we consider. We extend this constraint to discrete-time walks of fixed numbers of noninteracting particles for one kind of graph certificate; it remains an open question as to whether or not this constraint applies to the other graph certificates we consider.

<p><strong>5.    Transport properties of anyons in random topological environments</strong><br />
V. Zatloukal, L. Lehman, S. Singh, J. K. Pachos, G. K. Brennen<br />
Phys. Rev. B 90, 134201 (2014)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5000</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The quasi one-dimensional transport of Abelian and non-Abelian anyons is studied in the presence of a random topological background. In particular, we consider the quantum walk of an anyon that braids around islands of randomly filled static anyons of the same type. Two distinct behaviours are identified. We analytically demonstrate that all types of Abelian anyons localise purely due to the statistical phases induced by their random anyonic environment. In contrast, we numerically show that non-Abelian Ising anyons do not localise. This is due to their entanglement with the anyonic environment that effectively induces dephasing. Our study demonstrates that localisation properties strongly depend on non-local topological interactions and it provides a clear distinction in the transport properties of Abelian and non-Abelian statistics.

<p><strong>6.    Wigner representation for polarization-momentum hyperentanglement generated in parametric down conversion, and its application to complete Bell-state measurement</strong><br />
A. Casado, S. Guerra, J. Pl��cido<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5013</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We apply the Wigner function formalism to the study of two-photon polarization-momentum hyperentanglement generated in parametric down conversion. It is shown that the consideration of a higher number of degrees of freedom is directly related to the extraction of additional uncorrelated sets of zeropoint modes at the source. We present a general expression for the description of the quantum correlations corresponding to the sixteen Bell base states, in terms of four beams whose amplitudes are correlated through the stochastic properties of the zeropoint field. A detailed analysis of the two experiments on complete Bell-state measurement included in [Walborn et al., Phys. Rev. A 68, 042313 (2003)] is made, emphasizing the role of the zeropoint field. Finally, we investigate the relationship between the zeropoint inputs at the source and the analysers, and the limits on optimal Bell-state measurement.

<p><strong>7.    Discrete Randomness in Discrete Time Quantum Walk: Study via Stochastic Averaging</strong><br />
D. Ellinas, A. J. Bracken, I. Smyrnakis<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5257</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The role of classical noise in quantum walks (QW) on integers is investigated in the form of discrete dichotomic random variable affecting its reshuffling matrix parametrized as a SU2)/U(1) coset element. Analysis in terms of quantum statistical moments and generating functions, derived by the completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) map governing evolution, reveals a pronounced eventual transition in walk's diffusion mode, from a quantum ballistic regime with rate O(t) to a classical diffusive regime with rate O(\surdt), when condition (strength of noise parameter)^{2}\times(number of steps)=1, is satisfied. The role of classical randomness is studied showing that the randomized QW, when treated on the stochastic average level by means of an appropriate CPTP averaging map, turns out to be equivalent to a novel quantized classical walk without randomness. This result emphasizes the dual role of quantization/randomization in the context of classical random walk.

<p><strong>8.    Cooperative quantum Parrondo’s games</strong><br />
?ukasz Pawela, Jan S?adkowski<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6954</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Coordination and cooperation are among the most important issues of game theory. Recently, the attention turned to game theory on graphs and social networks. Encouraged by interesting results obtained in quantum evolutionary game analysis, we study cooperative Parrondo's games in a quantum setup. The game is modeled using multidimensional quantum random walks with biased coins. We use the GHZ and W entangled states as the initial state of the coins. Our analysis shows than an apparent paradox in cooperative quantum games and some interesting phenomena can be observed.

<p><strong>9.    Discretely-observable continuous time quantum walks on M?bius strips and other exotic structures in 3D integrated photonics</strong><br />
Michael Delanty, M. J. Steel<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7143</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We theoretically analyze the dynamical evolution of photonic quantum walks on M\"obius strips and other exotic structures in 3D integrated photonics. Our flexible design allows discrete observations of continuous time quantum walks of photons in a variety of waveguide arrays. Furthermore, our design allows one to inject photons during the evolution, allowing the possibility of interacting with the photons as they are 'walking'. We find that non-trivial array topologies introduce novel time-dependent symmetries of the two-photon correlations. These properties allow a large degree of control for quantum state engineering of multimode entangled states in these devices.

<p><strong>10.    Quantum Walks</strong><br />
Daniel Reitzner, Daniel Nagaj, Vladimir Buzek<br />
Acta Physica Slovaca 61, No.6, 603-725 (2011)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7283</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This tutorial article showcases the many varieties and uses of quantum walks. Discrete time quantum walks are introduced as counterparts of classical random walks. The emphasis is on the connections and differences between the two types of processes (with rather different underlying dynamics) for producing random distributions. We discuss algorithmic applications for graph-searching and compare the two approaches. Next, we look at quantization of Markov chains and show how it can lead to speedups for sampling schemes. Finally, we turn to continuous time quantum walks and their applications, which provide interesting (even exponential) speedups over classical approaches.

<p><strong>11.    A note on the discrete-time evolutions of quantum walk on a graph</strong><br />
Yusuke Higuchi, Norio Konno, Iwao Sato, Etsuo Segawa<br />
Journal of Math-for-Industry, Vol.5 (2013B-3), pp.103-109 (2013)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4987</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For a quantum walk on a graph, there exist many kinds of operators for the discrete-time evolution. We give a general relation between the characteristic polynomial of the evolution matrix of a quantum walk on edges and that of a kind of transition matrix of a classical random walk on vertices. Furthermore we determine the structure of the positive support of the cube of some evolution matrix, which is said to be useful for isospectral problem in graphs, under a certain condition.

<p><strong>12.    Diagonalization of quasi-uniform tridiagonal matrices</strong><br />
Leonardo Banchi, Ruggero Vaia<br />
J. Math. Phys. 54, 043501 (2013)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.7307</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The task of analytically diagonalizing a tridiagonal matrix can be considerably simplified when a part of the matrix is uniform. Such quasi-uniform matrices occur in several physical contexts, both classical and quantum, where one-dimensional interactions prevail. These include magnetic chains, 1D arrays of Josephson junctions or of quantum dots, boson and fermion hopping models, random walks, and so on. In such systems the bulk interactions are uniform, and differences may occur around the boundaries of the arrays. Since in the uniform case the spectrum consists of a band, we exploit the bulk uniformity of quasi-uniform tridiagonal matrices in order to express the spectral problem in terms of a variation of the distribution of eigenvalues in the band and of the corresponding eigenvectors. In the limit of large matrices this naturally leads to a deformation of the density of states which can be expressed analytically; a few out-of-band eigenvalues can show up and have to be accounted for separately. The general procedure is illustrated with some examples.
