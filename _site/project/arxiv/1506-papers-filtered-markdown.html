    <p><strong>1.    The spreading behavior of quantum walks induced by drifted random walks on some magnifier graph</strong><br />
Yusuke Higuchi, Etsuo Segawa<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.00381</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper, we consider the quantum walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ with attachment of one-length path periodically. This small modification to $\mathbb{Z}$ provides localization of the quantum walk. The eigenspace causing this localization is generated by finite length round trip paths. We find that the localization is due to the eigenvalues of an underlying random walk. Moreover we find that the transience of the underlying random walk provides a slow down of the pseudo velocity of the induced quantum walk and a different limit distribution from the Konno distribution.

<p><strong>2.    A discrete spacetime model for quantum mechanics</strong><br />
Antonio Sciarretta<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.00817</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper presents a simple model that mimics quantum mechanics (QM) results in terms of probability fields of free particles subject to self-interference, without using Schroedinger equation or complex wavefunctions. Unlike the standard QM picture, the proposed model only uses integer-valued quantities and arithmetic operations. In particular, it assumes a discrete spacetime under the form of an euclidean lattice. The proposed approach describes individual particle trajectories as random walks. Transition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are either randomly associated to the particles during their preparation, or stored in the lattice sites they visit during the walk. Non-relativistic QM predictions, particularly selfinterference, are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly-prepared ensembles of particles. Extension to interacting particles is discussed but not detailed in this paper.

<p><strong>3.    From Disordered Quantum Walk to Physics of Off-diagonal Disorder</strong><br />
Qifang Zhao, Jiangbin Gong<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.01189</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Systems with purely off-diagonal disorder have peculiar features such as the localization-delocalization transition and long-range correlations in their wavefunctions. To motivate possible experimental studies of the physics of off-diagonal disorder, we study in detail disordered discrete-time quantum walk in a finite chain, where the diagonal disorder can be set to zero by construction. Starting from a transfer matrix approach, we show, both theoretically and computationally, that the dynamics of the quantum walk with disorder manifests all the main features of off-diagonal disorder. We also propose how to prepare a remarkable delocalized zero-mode from a localized and easy-to-prepare initial state using an adiabatic protocol that increases the disorder strength slowly. Numerical experiments are also performed with encouraging results.

<p><strong>4.    On the behavior of quantum walks confined to a cycle coupled with a half line</strong><br />
Forrest Ingram-Johnson, Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.01940</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When confined to a topological environment consisting of a cycle coupled with a half-line, quantum walks exhibit long-term statistical tendencies which differ dramatically from the tendencies of classical random walks in the same environment. In particular, as suggested by numerical simulations, the probability distribution of the walker's position resolves, in part, into a non-vanishing distribution on the cycle and, in part, into a ballistic distribution on the half-line. By contrast, for a classical random walk, the probability distribution of the walker's position tends always to vanish on the cycle and to migrate completely to the half-line as a purely diffusive process.

<p><strong>5.    Quantum walks in the density operator picture</strong><br />
Chaobin Liu<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.02493</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A new approach to quantum walks is presented. Considering a quantum system undergoing some unitary discrete-time evolution in a directed graph G, we think of the vertices of G as sites that are occupied by the quantum system, whose internal state is described by density operators. To formulate the unitary evolution, we define reflections in the tensor product of an internal Hilbert space and a spatial Hilbert space. We then construct unitary channels that govern the evolution of the system in the graph. The discrete dynamics of the system (called quantum walks) is obtained by iterating the unitary channel on the density operator of the quantum system. It turns out that in this framework, the action of the unitary channel on a density operator is described by the usual matrix multiplication.

<p><strong>6.    Continuous-time quantum walks over connected graphs, amplitudes and invariants</strong><br />
Phillip Dukes<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.03086</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the time dependent amplitude $ \phi_{i}\left( t\right)$ at each vertex of a continuous-time quantum walk on a variety of connected graphs. The Lissajous curve of the real vs. imaginary parts of each $ \phi_{i}\left( t\right)$ often reveals an interesting shape of the "space of accessible amplitudes." We find that, depending on the graph and initial state of the walker, the time evolution of the quantum walk can result in a static probability distribution over the vertices or have the walker never visit some connected vertices. We also find two invariants of continuous-time quantum walks. First, considering the rate at which each amplitude changes in time we find the scalar quantity $T = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \|\dfrac{d \phi_{i}\left( t\right) }{d t}\|^{2}$ is invariant. Second, the vector area of a continuous patch of contingent amplitude space at each vertex is time dependent; however the total vector area is invariant.

<p><strong>7.    Coherent chemical kinetics as quantum walks I: Reaction operators for radical pairs</strong><br />
A. Chia, A. Gorecka, K. C. Tan, L. Pawela, P. Kurzynski, T. Paterek, D. Kaszlikowski<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.04213</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Classical chemical kinetics use rate-equation models to describe how a reaction proceeds in time. Such models are sufficient for describing state transitions in a reaction where coherences between different states do not arise, or in other words, a reaction which contain only incoherent transitions. A prominent example reaction containing coherent transitions is the radical-pair model. The kinetics of such reactions is defined by the so-called reaction operator which determines the radical-pair state as a function of intermediate transition rates. We argue that the well-known concept of quantum walks from quantum information theory is a natural and apt framework for describing multisite chemical reactions. By composing Kraus maps that act only on two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied to derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction. Our reaction operator predicts a recombination dephasing rate consistent with recent experiments [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 139}, 234309 (2013)], in contrast to previous work by Jones and Hore [Chem. Phys. Lett. {\bf 488}, 90 (2010)]. The standard radical-pair reaction has conventionally been described by either a normalised density operator incorporating both the radical pair and reaction products, or by a trace-decreasing density operator that considers only the radical pair. We demonstrate a density operator that is both normalised and refers only to radical-pair states. Generalisations to include additional dephasing processes and an arbitrary number of sites are also discussed.

<p><strong>8.    Nonlinear Optical Galton Board: thermalization and continuous limit</strong><br />
Giuseppe Di Molfetta, Fabrice Debbasch, Marc Brachet<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.04323</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The nonlinear optical Galton board (NLOGB), a quantum walk like (but nonlinear) discrete time quantum automaton, is shown to admit a complex evolution leading to long time thermalized states. The continuous limit of the Galton Board is derived and shown to be a nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE). The (Galerkin truncated) NLDE evolution is shown to thermalize toward states qualitatively similar to those of the NLOGB. The NLDE conserved quantities are derived and used to construct a stochastic differential equation converging to grand canonical distributions that are shown to reproduce the (micro canonical) NLDE thermalized statistics. Both the NLOGB and the Galerkin-truncated NLDE are thus demonstrated to exhibit spontaneous thermalization.

<p><strong>9.    Limited preparation contextuality in quantum theory and its relation to the Cirel’son bound</strong><br />
Manik Banik, Some Sankar Bhattacharya, Amit Mukherjee, Arup Roy, Andris Ambainis, Ashutosh Rai<br />
Phys. Rev. A 92, 030103(R) (2015)<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.05174</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem lies at the heart of the foundations of quantum mechanics. It establishes impossibility of explaining predictions of quantum theory by any noncontextual ontological model. Spekkens generalized the notion of KS contextuality in [Phys. Rev. A 71, 052108 (2005)] for arbitrary experimental procedures (preparation, measurement, and transformation procedure). Interestingly, later on it was shown that preparation contextuality powers parity-oblivious multiplexing [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010401 (2009)], a two party information theoretic game. Thus, using resources of a given operational theory, the maximum success probability achievable in such a game suffices as a \emph{bona-fide} measure of preparation contextuality for the underlying theory. In this work we show that preparation contextuality in quantum theory is more restricted compared to a general operational theory known as \emph{box world}. Moreover, we find that this limitation of quantum theory implies the quantitative bound on quantum nonlocality as depicted by the Cirel'son bound.

<p><strong>10.    Zak Phase in Discrete-Time Quantum Walks</strong><br />
G. Puentes, O. Santill��n<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.08100</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We report on a simple scheme that may present a non-trivial geometric Zak phase ($\Phi_{Zak}$) structure, which is based on a discrete-time quantum walk architecture. By detecting the Zak phase difference between two trajectories connecting adjacent Dirac points where the quasi-energy gap closes for opposite values of quasi-momentum ($k$), it is possible to identify geometric invariants. These geometric invariants correspond to $|\Phi_{Zak}^{+(-)}-\Phi_{Zak}^{-(+)}|=\pi$ and $|\Phi_{Zak}^{+(-)}-\Phi_{Zak}^{+(-)}|=0$, we argue that this effect can be directly measured.

<p><strong>11.    Implementation of multidimensional quantum walks using linear optics and classical light</strong><br />
Sandeep K. Goyal, Filippus S. Roux, Andrew Forbes, Thomas Konrad<br />
Phys. Rev. A 92, 040302(R), (2015)<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.08703</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Classical optics can be used to efficiently implement certain quantum information processing tasks with a high degree of control, for example, one-dimensional quantum walks through the space of orbital angular momentum of light directed by its polarization. To explore the potential of quantum information processing with classical light, we here suggest a method to realize d-dimensional quantum walks with classical optics---an important step towards robust implementation of certain quantum algorithms. In this scheme, different degrees of freedom of light, such as frequency, orbital angular momentum, and time bins, represent different directions for the walker while the coin to decide which direction the walker takes is realized by employing the polarization combined with different light paths.

<p><strong>12.    Harnessing high-dimensional hyperentanglement through a biphoton frequency comb</strong><br />
Zhenda Xie, Tian Zhong, Sajan Shrestha, XinAn Xu, Junlin Liang, Yan-Xiao Gong, Joshua C. Bienfang, Alessandro Restelli, Jeffrey H. Shapiro, Franco N. C. Wong, Chee Wei Wong<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.04231</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for secure information processing and communications, where hyperentanglement or high-dimensional entanglement has been separately proposed towards high data capacity and error resilience. The continuous-variable nature of the energy-time entanglement makes it an ideal candidate for efficient high-dimensional coding with minimal limitations. Here we demonstrate the first simultaneous high-dimensional hyperentanglement using a biphoton frequency comb to harness the full potential in both energy and time domain. The long-postulated Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum revival is exhibited, with up to 19 time-bins, 96.5% visibilities. We further witness the high-dimensional energy-time entanglement through Franson revivals, which is observed periodically at integer time-bins, with 97.8% visibility. This qudit state is observed to simultaneously violate the generalized Bell inequality by up to 10.95 deviations while observing recurrent Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt S-parameters up to 2.76. Our biphoton frequency comb provides a platform in photon-efficient quantum communications towards the ultimate channel capacity through energy-time-polarization high-dimensional encoding.

<p><strong>13.    Separations in Query Complexity Based on Pointer Functions</strong><br />
Andris Ambainis, Kaspars Balodis, Aleksandrs Belovs, Troy Lee, Miklos Santha, Juris Smotrovs<br />
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.04719</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1986, Saks and Wigderson conjectured that the largest separation between deterministic and zero-error randomized query complexity for a total boolean function is given by the function $f$ on $n=2^k$ bits defined by a complete binary tree of NAND gates of depth $k$, which achieves $R_0(f) = O(D(f)^{0.7537\ldots})$. We show this is false by giving an example of a total boolean function $f$ on $n$ bits whose deterministic query complexity is $\Omega(n/\log(n))$ while its zero-error randomized query complexity is $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. This shows that the relations $D(f) \le R_0(f)^2$ and $D(f) \le 2R_1(f)^2$ are optimal, up to poly-logarithmic factors. We further show that the quantum query complexity of the same function is $\tilde O(n^{1/4})$, giving the first example of a total function with a super-quadratic gap between its quantum and deterministic query complexities. Variations of this function give new separations between several other query complexity measures, including: the first super-linear separation between bounded-error and zero-error randomized complexity, larger gaps between exact quantum query complexity and deterministic/randomized query complexities, and a 4th power separation between approximate degree and bounded-error randomized complexity. All of these examples are variants of a function recently introduced by G\"{o}\"{o}s, Pitassi, and Watson which they used to separate the unambiguous 1-certificate complexity from deterministic query complexity and to resolve the famous Clique versus Independent Set problem in communication complexity.
