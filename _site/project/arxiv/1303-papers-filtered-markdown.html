    <p><strong>1.    Nonreversal and nonrepeating quantum walks</strong><br />
T. J. Proctor, K. E. Barr, B. Hanson, S. Martiel, V. Pavlovic, A. Bullivant, V. M. Kendon<br />
Phys. Rev. A 89, 042332 (2014)<br />

<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a variation of the discrete time quantum walk, the nonreversal quantum walk, which does not step back onto a position which it has just occupied. This allows us to simulate a dimer and we achieve it by introducing a new type of coin operator. The nonrepeating walk, which never moves in the same direction in consecutive time steps, arises by a permutation of this coin operator. We describe the basic properties of both walks and prove that the even-order joint moments of the nonrepeating walker are independent of the initial condition, being determined by five parameters derived from the coin instead. Numerical evidence suggests that the same is the case for the nonreversal walk. This contrasts strongly with previously studied coins, such as the Grover operator, where the initial condition can be used to control the standard deviation of the walker.

<p><strong>2.    Psi-Epistemic Theories: The Role of Symmetry</strong><br />
Scott Aaronson, Adam Bouland, Lynn Chua, George Lowther<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2834</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Formalizing an old desire of Einstein, "psi-epistemic theories" try to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, while viewing quantum states as ordinary probability distributions over underlying objects called "ontic states." Regardless of one's philosophical views about such theories, the question arises of whether one can cleanly rule them out, by proving no-go theorems analogous to the Bell Inequality. In the 1960s, Kochen and Specker (who first studied these theories) constructed an elegant psi-epistemic theory for Hilbert space dimension d=2, but also showed that any deterministic psi-epistemic theory must be "measurement contextual" in dimensions 3 and higher. Last year, the topic attracted renewed attention, when Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph (PBR) showed that any psi-epistemic theory must "behave badly under tensor product." In this paper, we prove that even without the Kochen-Specker or PBR assumptions, there are no psi-epistemic theories in dimensions d&gt;=3 that satisfy two reasonable conditions: (1) symmetry under unitary transformations, and (2) "maximum nontriviality" (meaning that the probability distributions corresponding to any two non-orthogonal states overlap). This no-go theorem holds if the ontic space is either the set of quantum states or the set of unitaries. The proof of this result, in the general case, uses some measure theory and differential geometry. On the other hand, we also show the surprising result that without the symmetry restriction, one can construct maximally-nontrivial psi-epistemic theories in every finite dimension d.

<p><strong>3.    Discrete-time quantum walk with feed-forward quantum coin</strong><br />
Yutaka Shikano, Tatsuaki Wada, Junsei Horikawa<br />
Sci. Rep. 4, 4427 (2014)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3432</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Constructing a discrete model like a cellular automaton is a powerful method for understanding various dynamical systems. However, the relationship between the discrete model and its continuous analogue is, in general, nontrivial. As a quantum-mechanical cellular automaton, a discrete-time quantum walk is defined to include various quantum dynamical behavior. Here we generalize a discrete-time quantum walk on a line into the feed-forward quantum coin model, which depends on the coin state of the previous step. We show that our proposed model has an anomalous slow diffusion characterized by the porous-medium equation, while the conventional discrete-time quantum walk model shows ballistic transport.

<p><strong>4.    Glued trees algorithm under phase damping</strong><br />
J. Lockhart, C. Di Franco, M. Paternostro<br />
Phys. Lett. A 378, 338 (2014)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5319</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the behaviour of the glued trees algorithm described by Childs et al. in [STOC `03, Proc. 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (2004) 59] under decoherence. We consider a discrete time reformulation of the continuous time quantum walk protocol and apply a phase damping channel to the coin state, investigating the effect of such a mechanism on the probability of the walker appearing on the target vertex of the graph. We pay particular attention to any potential advantage coming from the use of weak decoherence for the spreading of the walk across the glued trees graph.

<p><strong>5.    Qunatum Parrondo’s games constructed by quantum random walk</strong><br />
Min Li, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Guang-Can Guo<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6831</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We construct a Parrondo's game using discrete time quantum walks. Two lossing games are represented by two different coin operators. By mixing the two coin operators $U_{A}(\alpha_{A},\beta_{A},\gamma_{A})$ and $U_{B}(\alpha_{B},\beta_{B},\gamma_{B})$, we may win the game. Here we mix the two games in position instead of time. With a number of selections of the parameters, we can win the game with sequences ABB, ABBB, \emph{et al}. If we set $\beta_{A}=45^{\circ},\gamma_{A}=0,\alpha_{B}=0,\beta_{B}=88^{\circ}$, we find the game 1\emph{  {with {\normalsize $U_{A}^{S}=U^{S}(-51^{\circ},45^{\circ},0)$, $U_{B}^{S}=U^{S}(0,88^{\circ},-16^{\circ})$ will win and get the most profit.}If we set $\alpha_{A}=0,\beta_{A}=45^{\circ},\alpha_{B}=0,\beta_{B}=88^{\circ}$ and{\normalsize{  { the game 2 with $U_{A}^{S}=U^{S}(0,45^{\circ},-51^{\circ})$, $U_{B}^{S}=U^{S}(0,88^{\circ},-67^{\circ})$, will win most.

<p><strong>6.    Quantum percolation and transition point of a directed discrete-time quantum walk</strong><br />
C. M. Chandrashekar, Th. Busch<br />
Scientific Reports 4, 6583 (2014)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7013</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum percolation describes the problem of a quantum particle moving through a disordered system. While certain similarities to classical percolation exist, the quantum case has additional complexity due to the possibility of Anderson localisation. Here, we consider a directed discrete-time quantum walk as a model to study quantum percolation of a two-state particle on a two-dimensional lattice. Using numerical analysis we determine the fraction of connected edges required (transition point) in the lattice for the two-state particle to percolate with finite (non-zero) probability for three fundamental lattice geometries, finite square lattice, honeycomb lattice, and nanotube structure and show that it tends towards unity for increasing lattice sizes. To support the numerical results we also use a continuum approximation to analytically derive the expression for the percolation probability for the case of the square lattice and show that it agrees with the numerically obtained results for the discrete case. Beyond the fundamental interest to understand the dynamics of a two-state particle on a lattice (network) with disconnected vertices, our study has the potential to shed light on the transport dynamics in various quantum condensed matter systems and the construction of quantum information processing and communication protocols.

<p><strong>7.    Quantum search with interacting Bose-Einstein condensates</strong><br />
Mahdi Ebrahimi Kahou, David L. Feder<br />
Phys. Rev. A 88, 032310 (2013)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3537</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One approach to the development of quantum search algorithms is the quantum walk. A spatial search can be effected by the continuous-time evolution of a single quantum particle on a graph containing a marked site. In many physical implementations, however, one might expect to have multiple particles. In interacting bosonic systems at zero temperature, the dynamics is well-described by a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We investigate the role of nonlinearity in determining the efficiency of the spatial search algorithm within the quantum walk model, for the complete graph. The analytical calculations reveal that the nonlinear search time scales with size of the search space N like the square root of N, equivalent to the linear case though with a different overall constant. The results indicate that interacting Bose-Einstein condensates at zero temperature could be natural systems for the implementation of the quantum search algorithm.

<p><strong>8.    Open quantum random walks: bi-stability on pure states and ballistically induced diffusion</strong><br />
Michel Bauer, Denis Bernard, Antoine Tilloy<br />
Phys. Rev. A88, 062340 (2013)<br />
http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6658</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Open quantum random walks (OQRWs) deal with quantum random motions on the line for systems with internal and orbital degrees of freedom. The internal system behaves as a quantum random gyroscope coding for the direction of the orbital moves. We reveal the existence of a transition, depending on OQRW moduli, in the internal system behaviors from simple oscillations to random flips between two unstable pure states. This induces a transition in the orbital motions from usual diffusion to ballistically induced diffusion with large mean free path and large effective diffusion constant at large time. We also show that mixed states of the internal system are converted into random pure states during the process. We touch upon possible experimental realizations.
